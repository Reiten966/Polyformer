# Polyformer
## To Reshape, Recreate, Reproduce.

As of late 2025, Polyformer is no longer supported due to a shift of focus in my life. Thanks for the amazing support of the community over the past 3 years. You could follow my future work at @reiten966



Polyformer is an open-source project that aims to recycle plastics into FDM filaments

Note: The EBB42 V1.2.1 in the kit is no longer conpatible with the old firmware, please source EBB42 V1.2/V1.1 or help updating the firmware to support the new board.


The part kit is available at [Triangle Lab-Global](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFp1dtz) and [DFH-US](https://dfh.fm/collections/new-products/products/polyformer-kit-by-reiten966).

Make sure your printer can print over 260C and is not PTFE lined.

Working on this project will expose you to HIGH VOLTAGE COMPONENTS and moderate amount of VOC. Please ask for help from a maker or electrician with the electronics assembly. The project owner is not responsible for any damage and loss to the end users.
