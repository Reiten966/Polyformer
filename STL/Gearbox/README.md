60% more torque at 2/3 the efficiency of the original!

Print two of each of the planet gears. When assembling, the planet gears should be evenly spaced around the ring gear (ie 90 degrees apart) and matching planets should be opposite each other. The faces with the squares/circles should be facing up (ie away from the stepper motor).

Print in PLA/PLA+ using the recommended PF print settings. I haven't tested this design with other materials but I'd avoid PETG as it flexes too much and will likely cause binding. If you print it out of something other than PLA/PLA+ I'd be interested to know how you go!

Tolerances are mostly baked into the design.

Heat set inserts go into the 4 holes in the output gear and these line up with the holes in the spool holder.
