# rPET print settings

260-280C Nozzle temp

70-80C Bed Temp

120-130% flow (higher due to the hollow bore nature of the filament, needs to be calibrated)

20-40% fan

60mm/s minimum print speed

DRY YOUR PET BEFORE PRINT FOR BEST RESULT

Retraction and other settings is dependent on your printer, But in general PET behaves similarly to PETG.
One thing special about PET is that it requires you to print moderately fast, in order to prevent hot filament from staying too long inside the heatbreak which will lead to the filament crystalizing and jam inside the heatbreak. If you see the printed part turning white, that is also a sign of the filament staying hot for too long after exiting the nozzle, which you should fix by increasing the fan speed.
