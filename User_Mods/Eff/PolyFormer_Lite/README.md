FERNIE: 

Hello PolyPeople. I'll be developing the required documentation for the PolyFormerLite project as well as some Quality of Life Mods that should make the project more accessible to some parts of the world. If you have any suggestions, please, do let me know !

Hopefully, we'll be able to release the final version soon !
