sentence=Treat PCF8574, MCP23017 and Shift registers like pins, matrix keypad, touch screen handler,  button press and rotary encoder management (switches) on any supported IO (including DfRobot & Joysticks) with event handling, interchangable AVR/I2C(AT24) EEPROMs.
paragraph=Interchange between PCF8574, MCP23017, 74HC595, and regular pins. Fully debounced switches, rotary encoders, joystick encoder emulation (including on DfRobot), matrix keypads/keyboards, and touch screen input on any IO device that require no extra components in most cases. An EEPROM abstraction that works with AVR & I2C AT24x ROMs. Simple cross device btree collection.
